# FusionStudioComponents
This is a Fusion port of [StudioComponents](https://github.com/sircfenner/StudioComponents) by sircfenner. This is by no means a 1-1 port, but it's close enough to where you should be able to port over a plugin that uses StudioComponents with ease. There is bound to be mistakes, but hopefully those can be ironed out in the future.

There's no documentation at the moment, but each component has a property type that should give you an idea of what it expects for the properties.
